This software was written by Ajaykumar Kannan (kannan.ajay@gmail.com) as a part of the thesis required for the completion of my B.Tech degree at IIT Guwahati. This software is used to control the PID constants, the desired angles and the throttle of a quadrotor. It uses a specific communication protocol (Packet system) which I will elaborate upon at a later stage when I get the time.
